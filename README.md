AWS_boto3_EC2

Inthis repository i created multple python boto3 scripts for interacting with aws ec2 servers for different use cases. I mentioned that use cases as versions in below.

version-1.py: With the help of this file we will stop / start the any particular ec2 instance that should present in the aws console.

version-2.py: With this python script, we have to enter desired ec2 instance id to stop/start. if not it will ask you start/stop all the ec2 instances that should present in aws console

version-3.py: With this python script, Add one more argument to pass the start/stop action along with instance id. If no action is passed then it should ask for the action to be performed.
